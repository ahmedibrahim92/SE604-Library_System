# SE604-Library_System
Code Review Assignment for Class SE604, 2017.
This is an opensource project for [Online Library Management System](https://github.com/keya26/library), we updated/added some changes to use in our code review assignment.

# Objectives
After compeleting the assignment, student will:
 1. Gain knowledge about code review process. 
 2. Gain knowlege about secure code review.
 3. Gain knowlege about software vulnerabilities and how to detect them. 

# Required Readings [1 Mark]
You have to read some tutorials before starting in the assignment.
  1. Learn how to build PHP applications [PHP Crash Course](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/learn-build-php-crash-course/)
  2. Learn coding standards for PHP [PHP Coding Standards](http://flowframework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/TheDefinitiveGuide/PartV/CodingGuideLines/PHP.html)

# Setting Up Your Development Environment [1 Mark]
  1. Download and Setup [XAMPP v5.6.14](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/5.6.14/xampp-win32-5.6.14-3-VC11-installer.exe/download)
  2. Download the project or clone it using [GIT](https://git-scm.com/), you can check this link to know [How to clone a repository?](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
  3. Put the project in `C:\xampp\htdocs` folder on your machine to run it on `localhost` according to the Crash Course in the Readings
  4.  From XAMPP control panel, click start for Apache
  5. Open http://localhost:{default-port}/SE604-Library_System/
  6. Take a journey in the application(Signup, Login, Search for Book, ... etc.)
  7. Submit some snapshots
